			<h2> UW- Madison Student Seek Artists, Writers For Bus Project</h2>

				<p>Art history students Yusi Liu and Alex Polach could be commuting to class this fall on a Metro bus of their own creation.
				The two UW-Madison undergraduate students plan to temporarily cover more than a dozen buses in the city’s fleet with inspiring works of art and literature. They’ve put out a call to Dane County artists and creative writers to apply to have their work put on bus “wraps,” creating a moving gallery of local talent. The deadline to apply for the project is midnight Friday.
				Called “Art En Route,” the project was sparked by an idea from Polach, a senior in art history. Polach was doing a summer intern- ship at the Georgia Museum of Art when she spotted the innovative bus shelters in Athens, Georgia, designed by artists, and wondered if something similar could be done in Madison. She shared her idea with Liu, a junior studying art history and the classics, who is also director of the art committee of the Wisconsin Union Directorate.
				“What started out to be bus shelters eventually turned into bus wraps,” like those advertising restaurants or entertainment spots on Metro transit buses, explained Polach, who is associate director of development for the WUD art committee. Selected artists and writ- ers “will have their work photographed and printed on the exterior ad space.”
				Polach and Liu have pulled together grants and support for the project, and established the website artenrouteproject.com to take artist/writer applications. Selected participants will receive a
				$200 honorarium and have their work exhibited at Memorial
				Union in the fall. The decorated buses will wend through the area on various bus routes from September 1 through December 31.
				“We are the people who manage the Wisconsin Union gallery, and do all the programming and installation,” Liu
				said. “This year I really hoped to do more public art programs outside the student gallery exhibitions in the Union, trying to
				connect with the community and highlight our voices in the city.”
				Polach emphasized that artists and writers don’t have to submit actual designs or text for the buses, but only have to fill out a simple letter of interest online at artenrouteproject.com by the end of the day Friday. A panel of student and community jurors will select participants for the project by April 16.</p>
