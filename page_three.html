			<h2>Oscar Mayer Plant Now Set For July 31 Shutdown</h2>
				<h3> Judy Newman jdnewman@madison.com </h3>
				<h3> April 3, 2017</h3>

				<p> Oscar Mayer's new closing date is July 31, parent company
				Kraft Heinz confirmed Monday.
				"We have extended the final closure date of our factory in Madison through July 31, 2017, as we continue to transition the production of Oscar Mayer meats to other Kraft Heinz fac- tories in the United States," Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said in an email.
				Kraft Heinz had notified the state that March 31 would mark the shutdown of the longtime East Side factory. Mullen said extra time is needed to make sure production at the new loca- tions is operating smoothly.
				Production of Oscar Mayer round cold cuts ended on March 31; liver cheese loaf production will end by April 14; and man- ufacturing of square cold cuts will cease in Madison by April 30, Mullen said. But it will take until the end of July to tackle cleaning, maintenance and equipment dismantling.
				"Approximately 300 employees in Madison are currently as- sisting with the transition," Mullen said. "We sincerely thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to the fa- cility."
				The news confirms the Wisconsin State Journal's report in March about the extension that quoted Doug Leikness, presi- dent of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 538, which represents most of the non-management plant workers
				It also provides a new date from Kraft Heinz for the shutdown, and the company's acknowledgement of delays in the shift of production.
				Leikness said, though, Monday that he had not yet gotten offi- cial word of the July 31 date from Kraft Heinz.
				Kraft Heinz, based in Chicago and Pittsburgh, has not said where the work is going, but Leikness has said he has heard hot dog manufacturing went to Columbia, Missouri, while some other production was sent to Kirksville, Missouri.
				Madison's Oscar Mayer plant has been operating since 1919, with as many as 4,000 employees at its peak in the 1970s.</p>
